# Module 03 Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.

## Description

This website is a password generator. It asks the user to specify a length between 8 and 128 characters. Then it asks if the user wants to use lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers and/or special characters. If the user does not provide adequate parameters, an empty string will be returned with a message to try again. If appropriate parameters are provided, a randomly generated password is provided.

### User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

### Acceptance Criteria
